**IMPORTANT** 
Due to changes in Spotify API policy, only users registered on my Spotify Developer Dashboard can play with personalized songs. Feel free to demo without signing in or alternatively if you would like to play with personalized songs, open and issue including the email linked to your spotify account.
My first React application. Iffy on the spot is a game that puts you on the spot and tests how well you know the music you listen to. Sign in with Spotify and start playing!

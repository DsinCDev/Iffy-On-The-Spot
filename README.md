# Iffy On The Spot
My first React application. Iffy on the spot is a game that puts you on the spot and tests how well you know the music you listen to. Sign in with Spotify and start playing!

## Technologies
- Typescript
- React.js
- Vanilla CSS

### Libraries used
- ReactHowler

## TODO
- Conditional chaining of API calls to get more than 50 songs.
- Autocomplete or a more flexible answer checking algorithm.
- Integration with database to store sync a users music library on sign-in to reduce number of fetch requests
